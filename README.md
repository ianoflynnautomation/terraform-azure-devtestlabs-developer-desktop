## Summary

The main.tf file defines the infrastructure for a DevTest Lab environment with both Linux and Windows virtual machines, designed to spin up an environment for development or testing.

## What we will be doing



## Tools we'll be using

- Terraform
- Github actions
- Azure pipelines
- Azure azd


## Prerequisites

> This template will create infrastructure and deploy code to Azure. If you don't have an Azure Subscription, you can sign up for a [free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Make sure you have contributor role to the Azure subscription.
The following prerequisites are required to use this application. Please ensure that you have them all installed locally.

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install)
- [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) - for the API backend

## Overview
### Scope: 
- Subscription-level deployment. 

### Purpose:
 Provision a DevTest Lab environment with: 
- A configurable Linux application server/ windows application server vm to deploy for example a deployment of an onprem docker enviroment.
- Multiple Windows client VMs for system testing where you need more control over the VM's (For example, hardware in the loop testing ).


## Key Resources
### DevTest Lab:
 - Creates a DevTest Lab named devtestlab (default).

### Linux Application Server:
- Single VM for application hosting.
- Ubuntu-based (default image: 20.04 LTS).
- Preinstalled artifacts such as Docker, Docker compose plugin, agent etc.

### Windows Client VMs:
- Deploys one or more Windows VMs (up to 10).
- Default: Windows 11 (Pro, 22H2).ß
- Preinstalled artifacts needed for test execution such as browsers, powershell, nodejs etc.

## Application Architecture

This application utilizes the following Azure resources:

- [**Azure DevTest Labs**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview) to managing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs) in labs.



## Quickstart
To learn how to get started with any azure azd, follow the steps in [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Developer CLI template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/get-started?tabs=localinstall&pivots=programming-language-nodejs) 

This quickstart will show you how to authenticate on Azure, initialize using a template, provision infrastructure and deploy code on Azure via the following commands:

```bash
# Log in to azd. Only required once per-install.
azd auth login

# First-time project setup. Initialize a project in the current directory.
azd init 

# Provision and deploy to Azure
azd up

# Clean up resources
azd down
```
